I'm Leonardo Laurindo, currently specializing in Data Science and Analytics at PUC-Rio. My academic journey took a unique path where I have a Master of Science degree in a different field, broadening my perspectives and analytical skills. With a combined four years of research experience and studies, I am keen to apply my diversified knowledge base to the world of Data Science and Analytics to generate the maximum possible value from data. I will also begin to document my studies and learning on my hashnode blog.

As of right now, my stack includes PostgreSQL, Bigquery, python and its EDA and machine learning libraries, like pandas, numpy, scipy, statsmodel, scikit-learn and a bit of pytorch. My goal right now is to fine tune my modelling programming skills as well as containerization technologies like docker.

You can find me on my linkedin or mail me with the badges above.
