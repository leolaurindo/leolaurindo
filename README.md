I'm Leonardo Laurindo, currently working with analytics and BI at Sony Music.

My academic journey took a unique path. I have a Master of Science degree in Law Sciences, but decided to broaden my perspectives and analytical skills. With a combined four years of research experience and studies, I am keen to apply my diversified knowledge base to the world of Data Science and Analytics to generate the maximum possible value from data.

To help this transformative journey, I decided that start postgraduate studies in "Data Science and Analytics" specialization at PUC-Rio. I also received the Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900) from Microsoft.

As of right now, my stack includes PostgreSQL, Bigquery, python and its EDA and machine learning libraries, like pandas, numpy, scipy, statsmodel, scikit-learn and a bit of pytorch. My goal right now is to fine tune my modelling programming skills as well as containerization technologies like docker.

You can find me on my linkedin or mail me with the badges above.
